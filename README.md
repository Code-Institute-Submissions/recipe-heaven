# Recipe Heaven

For this project, I am to build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

I have created a site that allows users to locate Electric Vehicle charging stations near by and provide details of privately owned chargers to add to the EVCN.

## UX

The site is aimed at cooking enthusiast of all levels that want to backup hand written recipes that migth be miss placed or destoryed. EV owners with and without privately owned charging stations on their properties. The site will find the users location and provide the user with all available charging stations, from public charging stations to private charging stations. The site also allows users to add their own charging station to EVCN via email.

- As a user type, I want to see all available charging stations that are near me.

## Features

### Existing Features

EVCN is a super easy cluster free site. The site is a one page site, broken up into three main sections, Landing page EVCN Map and Contact Us

#### Home

Eye catching landing page providing a brief overview of what the site has to offer.

#### EVCN Map

EVCN Map section providing instant feedback on the users location.

#### Contact Us

Contact us section requires the user to input their name email address and details on their charging station.

### Features Left to Implement

#### Search function

A text input search function, that allows the user to search for charging stations in other areas.

#### Infowindow

In future I would like to implement a popup info window for every marker of the search results to show the name address and type of charging station.

#### Side panel with brief description

The side panel will display name address type of charging station number of chargers, avaiablitiy of chargers and a rating of the station. A get direction with way points button.

#### Members sign in section

I would also like to add a sign up and login button that would give members access to a list of privately owed chargers that the members could use when they are available.
